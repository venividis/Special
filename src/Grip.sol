  THE GRIP — the hand that only closes

  Origin: IPSEITY src/GripVault.sol, verbatim (DESIGN.md §3 row 7, §9.3).
  The only change is the name: the salt that places it, `intact.grip.v1`,
  lives in src/lib/AccountBinding.sol and the hub, not here — a Grip's code
  has no idea which salt deployed it, which is as it should be.

  A second ERC-6551 account for every token, at a second salt. It receives
  and it does not spend. There is no `execute`, no `withdraw`, no sweep, no
  rescue, no owner override, and no admin. Read the ABI: there is no
  function on this contract that moves an asset out of it, for anybody,
  ever. `tools/verify-vault.mjs` enumerates every selector of the compiled
  contract against src/interfaces/IGrip.sol and asserts exactly that.

  ── why this rather than a better guard ──

  The other account in this collection — the Reach, src/Reach.sol — can be
  sealed for a time, and enforces that seal by measuring its own balances
  either side of every call. That works, and the suite proves it works,
  but look at what it cost: a manifest, a snapshot, a verification pass, a
  deny-by-default word list, a delegatecall ban, an ERC-1271 wall, and a
  documented blind spot for assets nobody thought to list. Every one of
  those exists because the capability to spend exists and is being
  policed.

  This contract does not police the capability. It does not have it. The
  entire attack surface for "can the holder get the assets out" is a
  function that was never written. There is nothing to measure because
  there is nothing to measure against, no list to keep current, and no
  blind spot, because there is no sight line to be blind along.

  That asymmetry is the whole idea, and it is not ours: it is the Gate
  from the CONGREGATION meld design — *"Grip → Reach: never. No function
  exists. Not for the bearer, not for the mind, not for governance."*

  ── what it costs ──

  Permanence is not a feature that can be walked back. An asset sent here
  is here until the token that owns it stops existing, which in this
  collection is never — there is no burn. A mistaken transfer into a Grip
  is a permanent mistake, and the page says so before it will build the
  calldata.

  This is the correct trade for the thing it is for: holdings a token
  carries as part of what it *is*, priced by every future buyer, provable
  without trusting a promise. It is the wrong trade for anything that has
  to stay liquid. Market inventory therefore lives in Pool.sol behind a
  time-boxed seal, and working capital lives in the Reach. Three places,
  three different promises, on purpose. The holder may route every income
  leg here with the hub's `feesToGrip` bit, and the page says "income into
  the Grip is permanently unspendable" before the bit is set.

  ── what a buyer reads ──

  `holdings()` reports what this Grip contains right now. Because nothing
  can leave, that reading is not a snapshot that could be stale by the time
  a sale settles — it is a floor. That is the entire point: the number a
  buyer sees before they pay is a number the seller cannot move.
