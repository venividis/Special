  Hook — what a v4 hook's address already tells you

  Uniswap v4 does something no other protocol here does: it puts a
  contract's *permissions in its address*. The PoolManager decides whether
  to call a hook's `beforeSwap` by testing one bit of the hook's own
  address. Fourteen callbacks, fourteen bits, the low fourteen.

  Two consequences, and both of them are unusually good for a page that
  cannot fetch anything.

  **A hook's powers are legible with no call at all.** Paste an address and
  this library says exactly which of the fourteen callbacks the pool will
  hand it, from the address alone — no RPC, no ABI, no source, and nothing
  the hook's author can lie about. A hook cannot claim not to intercept
  swaps while having the swap bit set, because the bit *is* what makes the
  interception happen. That is a stronger guarantee than reading verified
  source, which tells you what the code says and not what the pool will do.

  **And a hook cannot be deployed to just any address.** To have the powers
  it declares, its address must carry those bits — which means mining a
  CREATE2 salt until the derived address matches. Roughly 2^14 tries for a
  full pattern. That is why `Kiln` mines salts in an `eth_call`: the browser
  has no keccak, and this contract does.

  Reproduced from `v4-core/src/libraries/Hooks.sol` rather than imported,
  because this collection compiles from `src/` with no dependency tree. The
  values are the ones the deployed PoolManager tests against; a different
  set here would describe every hook on the site wrongly.
