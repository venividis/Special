  Tick — the price ladder a v3 pool actually stores

  A Uniswap v3 pool does not store a price. It stores a tick: an integer `t`
  meaning the price 1.0001^t. Every boundary of every liquidity position is
  one of these integers, the oracle records them rather than prices, and the
  only price a pool will accept when it is created is the square root of one
  of them in Q64.96.

  So three of the things this site offers cannot be built without the
  conversion:

    · the chart, which reads ticks out of the pool's own oracle and has to
      turn each one into a number a person can read;
    · creating a pool, which needs `sqrtPriceX96` for the starting price;
    · a range order — a one-sided position that fills as the price crosses
      it, which is what a limit order is when nobody is running a server —
      whose two bounds are ticks and whose real fill price is whatever those
      ticks mean, not whatever the person typed.

  ── why this is on chain and not in the browser ──

  The client can find the *approximate* tick for a price with a logarithm in
  double precision, and that is fine, because a tick is a choice and being
  one tick out is being 0.01% out on a number the person is about to be
  shown. What must not happen is the page telling someone their order fills
  at the price they typed. So the browser picks a tick and this contract
  says what that tick is exactly worth, and the page shows the second number.

  Approximate to choose, exact to display. The half of the job that needs a
  logarithm is the half where being slightly wrong costs nothing.

  ── the table ──

  `sqrtAt` is Uniswap's own `TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick`, reproduced here
  rather than imported because this collection compiles from `src/` with no
  dependency tree. It is a binary decomposition: sqrt(1.0001) raised to each
  power of two is a constant, and multiplying together the constants whose
  bit is set in |tick| gives sqrt(1.0001^|tick|) in Q128.128. A negative
  tick is the reciprocal, taken at the end. The magic numbers are the
  constants, and they are the same nineteen values the pools themselves use
  — a different set would price every position on this site differently from
  the pool it is sent to.
