  INTACT · Timelock — the only curator

  Origin: IPSEITY src/lib/Timelock.sol, VERBATIM (BUILD-PLAN.md U5; DESIGN.md
  §3 row 27 "V, wired", §4.7). Nothing below this header is changed: the
  byte count the plan pins (1,675 in IPSEITY's table, measured there with
  the CBOR metadata hash still attached; INTACT compiles with
  `bytecodeHash: "none"`, so the same source measures a few dozen bytes
  less here — see the U5 commit body for the number) is the proof that the
  code is the donor's.

  How it is wired (DESIGN.md §4.7): the hub's `setPrice`, `setRoyalty`,
  `withdraw(to)` and `sealPricing()` accept calls only from the address
  this contract is deployed at, pinned as the hub's `TIMELOCK` immutable
  before the hub exists (CREATE3, §12). The admin is a burner at deployment
  and is handed to a 2-of-3 multisig, or renounced, through this contract's
  own queue. After `sealPricing` there is nothing left to curate.

  One discrepancy, recorded rather than resolved here: DESIGN.md §3 row 27
  says "admin queues; anyone executes", and the donor's `execute` is
  `onlyAdmin`. The plan says verbatim and pins the size, so the donor's
  rule stands; dropping `onlyAdmin` from `execute` is a one-word change if
  the integrator wants the open form. tools/verify-timelock.mjs asserts the
  donor's rule ("a stranger executing" is refused) so the choice is visible.

  TIMELOCK — a delay between an intention and its effect

  Every privileged path in this system is meant to end up here. Not because
  a delay makes a bad change good, but because it makes a bad change
  *visible* before it lands. The threat model is not a dishonest curator so
  much as a stolen key: without a delay, a compromised key is an instant
  loss and the first anyone knows of it is afterwards. With one, the same
  compromise is a queued transaction sitting in public for a week with an
  event announcing exactly what it will do.

  Adapted from the Dave Held core, with three changes:

    · admin is mutable, but only through this contract's own queue. An
      immutable admin cannot be rotated when the multisig behind it needs
      to change; an admin that can rotate itself instantly is not a
      timelock at all. So rotation is a queued operation like any other.

    · queued operations expire. Without a grace period a proposal sits
      executable forever, and an operation queued and forgotten a year ago
      is a live weapon for whoever eventually takes the key.

    · queue refuses to re-queue an operation that is already pending, so
      an eta cannot be quietly pushed around underneath a watcher.

  What it deliberately does not have: roles, guardians, a veto council, or
  any second address that can cancel. Every one of those is another key to
  steal. One admin, one delay, one public queue.
